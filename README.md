### App Idea

I would like to build an app called "BookBuddy" that connects book lovers. The app allows users to create a personalized book list and share it with friends. Some features I would like to implement are:

1. User registration and login
2. Creating and sharing book lists
3. Adding books to a personal library
4. Rating and reviewing books
5. Discussion forums for book recommendations
6. Ability to add books to a "wishlist"
7. Notifications for new book recommendations and updates to shared lists


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The main challenge was figuring out how to implement the button press event and change the screen color.
